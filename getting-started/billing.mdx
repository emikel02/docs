## What Happens at Your Limit

When you reach your monthly row limit:

- ❌ **Jobs are blocked** from starting
- ⚠️ **Clear error message** displays with usage details
- 💡 **Upgrade prompt** appears
- ⏸️ **Running jobs** pause if mid-processing

<Note>
  You won't be charged overage fees. Jobs simply won't run until you upgrade or your usage resets.
</Note>

## Billing Cycle and Reset

- **Usage resets** at the start of each billing cycle
- **No rollover** of unused rows
- **Monthly billing** cycle

<Warning>
  Unused rows do NOT roll over to the next month. Use them or lose them!
</Warning>

## How Rows Are Counted

Each template × each row = 1 usage

**Examples:**
| Rows | Templates | Usage |
|------|-----------|-------|
| 100 | 1 | 100 |
| 100 | 3 | 300 |
| 1,000 | 5 | 5,000 |

<Warning>
  Template tests also count toward usage! Each test consumes 1 row of your monthly allowance.
</Warning>

## Payment Methods

Smelt uses Stripe for secure payment processing:

- Credit/debit cards
- Some regions support additional methods

All payments are processed securely through Stripe. Smelt never sees your full card details.
