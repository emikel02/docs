## Auto-Fix Feature

<Info>
  Smelt automatically fixes certain issues **before** you see them!
</Info>

These are stripped automatically from every AI output:

| Issue | Auto-Fix |
|-------|----------|
| **Preambles** | "Here's a hook:", "Sure!", "Certainly!" → Removed |
| **Postambles** | "Let me know!", "Hope this helps!" → Removed |
| **Quote wrappers** | Surrounding quotation marks → Removed |

<Note>
  Flags shown in results are issues that **couldn't** be auto-fixed.
</Note>

## Flag Details

### too_short

**What it means:** Output is under 15 characters.

**Common causes:**
- AI misunderstood the prompt
- Input data was insufficient
- Template constraints too restrictive

**How to fix:**
- Edit inline to expand
- Re-run with revised prompt
- Check input data quality

---

### over_char_limit / over_word_limit

**What it means:** Output exceeded your template's length constraints.

**Common causes:**
- AI didn't fully respect limits
- Limits set too low for the task

**How to fix:**
- Edit to shorten
- Adjust template limits
- Make limit clearer in prompt ("MUST be under 100 characters")

---

### forbidden_word

**What it means:** Output contains a word you banned in the template.

**Common causes:**
- AI used the word despite instructions
- Word appears in a different form

**How to fix:**
- Edit to remove the word
- Make prohibition clearer in prompt
- Consider if the word is truly necessary to ban

<Tip>
  Forbidden word detection uses word boundaries—"loan" won't flag "loans" or "alone".
</Tip>

---

### has_preamble

**What it means:** Output starts with AI-style introductions.

**Examples:**
- "Here's a hook for you:"
- "Sure, here's what I came up with:"
- "Certainly!"

**Why it's flagged:** These should have been auto-fixed. If you see this flag, the preamble pattern wasn't recognized.

**How to fix:** Edit to remove the preamble manually.

---

### has_postamble

**What it means:** Output ends with AI-style sign-offs.

**Examples:**
- "Let me know if you need changes!"
- "Hope this helps!"
- "Feel free to ask for more!"

**Why it's flagged:** These should have been auto-fixed. If you see this flag, the postamble pattern wasn't recognized.

**How to fix:** Edit to remove the postamble manually.

---

### has_quotes

**What it means:** Output is wrapped in quotation marks.

**Example:**
```
"Scaling your SaaS team in Austin is no small feat—"
```

**Why it's flagged:** Should have been auto-fixed. Quotes suggest the AI is "presenting" rather than "being" the copy.

**How to fix:** Edit to remove surrounding quotes.

---

### has_placeholder

**What it means:** Output contains unfilled placeholders.

**Examples:**
- `[Name]`
- `{Company}`
- `{{variable}}`
- `[INSERT CITY HERE]`

**Common causes:**
- AI left placeholders instead of using data
- Variable wasn't found in CSV
- AI misunderstood the task

**How to fix:**
- Check that CSV has the expected columns
- Edit to fill in the placeholder
- Re-run after fixing the prompt

<Warning>
  This is a serious flag—placeholders will look terrible if sent to prospects!
</Warning>

---

### has_ai_speak

**What it means:** Output contains language revealing it's AI-generated.

**Examples:**
- "As an AI language model..."
- "I cannot provide..."
- "I don't have access to..."

**Common causes:**
- AI broke character
- Prompt triggered safety responses
- Unusual input data

**How to fix:**
- Edit to remove AI language
- Revise prompt to prevent this
- Check input data for issues

---

### has_cliche

**What it means:** Output contains overused phrases.

**Examples:**
- "I hope this email finds you well"
- "Circle back"
- "Touch base"
- "Low-hanging fruit"
- "Synergy"

**Why it matters:** These phrases are so common they reduce impact and feel generic.

**How to fix:**
- Edit to replace with more original phrasing
- Add clichés to forbidden words list

---

### generic

**What it means:** Output doesn't seem personalized to the specific lead.

**Detection:** Checks if the output could apply to almost any lead rather than being tailored.

**Common causes:**
- Not enough data in the CSV
- Prompt doesn't reference enough variables
- Template is too general

**How to fix:**
- Use more variables in your prompt
- Add more specific instructions
- Ensure CSV has relevant data

## Filtering by Quality

In the Results view, filter to show:

| Filter | Shows |
|--------|-------|
| **All results** | Everything |
| **Has flags** | Only outputs with quality issues |
| **No flags** | Only clean outputs |

<Tip>
  Review flagged outputs first, then bulk-approve clean ones.
</Tip>
