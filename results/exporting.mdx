# Exporting Results

Export your generated results as a CSV file, ready to import into your email sending tool.

## How to Export

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Job Results">
    Go to Jobs → Click a job → View Results
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Export">
    Click the **Export** button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Options">
    Choose which columns to include (optional)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download">
    CSV file downloads to your computer
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Export Format

Exports are CSV files containing:

| Included | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Original data** | All columns from your uploaded CSV |
| **Generated outputs** | New columns for each template's output |
| **Confidence scores** | Optional — input data quality scores |
| **Quality flags** | Optional — issues detected |

### Example Export

**Input CSV had:**
```
Name, Company, Email, City
```

**After job with 2 templates (Hook, CTA), export has:**
```
Name, Company, Email, City, Hook, CTA
```

## Column Selection

When exporting, you can choose:

- **All columns** — Everything including metadata
- **Essential columns** — Original data + generated outputs only
- **Custom selection** — Pick exactly which columns you need

<Tip>
  For email tools, usually you only need original data + generated outputs. Scores and flags are for your review, not for sending.
</Tip>

## Using Exports with Email Tools

Your exported CSV works directly with:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Instantly" icon="bolt">
    Import CSV, map columns to personalization variables
  </Card>
  <Card title="Lemlist" icon="lemon">
    Upload CSV, use column names as {{variables}}
  </Card>
  <Card title="Smartlead" icon="brain">
    Import CSV, configure personalization fields
  </Card>
  <Card title="Apollo" icon="rocket">
    Import to sequences with custom fields
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Column Mapping

Your output column names become personalization variables:

| Smelt Column | In Instantly | In Lemlist |
|--------------|--------------|------------|
| `Hook` | `{{Hook}}` | `{{Hook}}` |
| `Pain_Point` | `{{Pain_Point}}` | `{{Pain_Point}}` |
| `CTA` | `{{CTA}}` | `{{CTA}}` |

<Tip>
  Use clear, simple output column names like `Hook` or `CTA`. They become the variables you'll use in your sending tool.
</Tip>

## Export Filtering

You can export a filtered subset:

1. Apply filters in the results view (e.g., "No flags only")
2. Click Export
3. Only filtered results are exported

**Use cases:**
- Export only approved results
- Export only completed (not failed) rows
- Export results for a specific template

## Handling Large Exports

For jobs with many thousands of rows:

- Export may take a few seconds to generate
- File downloads when ready
- Large CSVs open fine in Excel/Sheets

## Re-importing to Smelt

You can use an exported CSV as input for future jobs:

1. Export results from Job A
2. Upload that CSV as a new file
3. The AI-generated columns are now available as variables
4. Create new templates that reference those columns

This enables **multi-stage workflows**:
- Stage 1 job generates hooks
- Export, re-upload
- Stage 2 job generates full emails using the hooks

<Note>
  For simpler multi-template workflows, use [template chaining](/templates/chaining) within a single job.
