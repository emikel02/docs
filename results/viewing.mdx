## Filtering Results

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="By Template" icon="file">

## Understanding the Columns

### Generated Output
The AI-generated text for each template. If you used multiple templates, each has its own output column.

### Confidence Score
A 0-100 rating of **input data quality**, not output quality:
- **80-100:** High — All key data present
- **50-79:** Medium — Some data missing
- **0-49:** Low — Significant data gaps

<Note>
  Low confidence means the AI had less context to work with. The output may be more generic.
</Note>

### Quality Flags
Automated warnings about potential issues. See [Quality Flags](/results/quality-flags) for the full list.

### Status
- **completed** — Successfully generated
- **failed** — Error occurred
- **pending** — Not yet processed (job in progress)
