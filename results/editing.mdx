# Editing Results

Edit individual outputs, perform bulk actions, or re-run problematic rows.

## Inline Editing

### How to Edit a Result

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click on a Result Row">
    Opens the detail panel
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Edit">
    Enter edit mode for the output text
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make Your Changes">
    Edit the generated copy as needed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Your changes are saved immediately
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What Happens When You Edit

- **Quality flags re-checked** — New flags may appear or disappear
- **Original preserved** — You can see what the AI generated
- **Marked as edited** — Results show they were manually modified

<Tip>
  Editing is great for small fixes. For systematic issues, consider revising the template and re-running.
</Tip>

## Bulk Actions

Select multiple results to perform bulk actions.

### Selecting Results

- **Click checkbox** — Select individual rows

### Available Bulk Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|

| **Delete** | Remove selected results permanently |
| **Re-run** | Re-generate selected rows |

<Warning>
  Bulk delete cannot be undone. Results are permanently removed.
</Warning>

### Bulk Approve/Reject Workflow

1. Filter to show only flagged results
2. Review each one quickly
3. Select rows that are acceptable despite flags
4. Click **Approve**
5. Select rows that need to be excluded
6. Click **Reject**

## Re-running Results

Re-run rows that failed or produced poor quality outputs.

### Re-run Selected

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Rows">
    Check the boxes for rows you want to re-run
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Re-run Selected">
    Selected rows are queued for re-processing
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for Processing">
    New outputs replace the old ones
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review New Results">
    Check if the new outputs are better
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Re-run All Failed

From the job details page:
1. Click **Re-run Failed**
2. Only rows with status "failed" are re-processed
3. Successful rows are not affected

### Re-run Flagged

Re-run only rows with quality flags:
1. Filter to "Has Flags"
2. Select all on page
3. Click **Re-run Selected**

<Warning>
  Re-runs count toward your monthly usage! Each re-run consumes 1 row per template.
</Warning>

## When to Edit vs Re-run

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Minor fix needed | Edit inline |
| One word wrong | Edit inline |
| Output completely off | Re-run |
| Same issue on many rows | Revise template, re-run all |
| AI ignored instructions | Revise template, re-run all |
