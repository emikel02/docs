## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Smelt?">
    Smelt is an AI-powered copy generation platform for creating personalized cold email content at scale. Upload your lead CSV, choose templates, and generate unique personalized copy for every prospect.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How is Smelt different from ChatGPT?">
    Smelt is designed for **batch processing**. ChatGPT can write one email at a time—you'd copy/paste each lead's info manually. Smelt reads your entire CSV and generates unique copy for every lead automatically, with quality scoring and export features.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How is Smelt different from Clay?">
    Different stages of the workflow:
    - **Clay** = Data enrichment (finding information about leads)
    - **Smelt** = Copy generation (writing personalized messages using your data)
    
    Many users use both: Clay to enrich, then Smelt to write.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What AI model does Smelt use?">
    GPT-4o-mini by default. This provides excellent quality at low cost. Model selection may expand in future updates.

    Automated warnings about potential issues in generated output. Smelt checks for 11 different issues including length problems, forbidden words, AI-speak, placeholders, and more.
  </Accordion>

## Security

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is my data secure?">
    Yes. Files are stored in encrypted cloud storage (AWS S3). Your data is isolated—other users cannot see it.
  </Accordion>

    API keys are encrypted with **AES-256-GCM** encryption. They are never stored in plain text and never visible after saving.
  </Accordion>

    Only you. All data is isolated per account. Smelt staff do not access customer data except for support requests with explicit permission.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I delete my data?">
    Yes. You can delete individual files from the Files page. Deleting a file removes it from cloud storage.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Does Smelt train on my data?">
    No. Your data is used only to generate your outputs. It is not used to train any AI models.
