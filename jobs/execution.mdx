Once you start a job, Smelt processes your rows in parallel for speed.

## Job Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **pending** | Queued, not yet started |
| **running** | Currently processing rows |
| **paused** | Temporarily stopped by user |
| **completed** | All rows processed successfully |
| **failed** | Error occurred, job stopped |
| **cancelled** | Manually cancelled by user |

## What Happens When a Job Starts

1. Status changes to **running**
2. Rows are processed in parallel (5 at a time)
3. Progress updates in real-time
4. Results are saved as they complete
5. Status changes to **completed** when done

## Progress Tracking

While a job runs, you'll see:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Rows processed** | X / total rows completed |
| **Success count** | Rows that generated successfully |
| **Failed count** | Rows that encountered errors |
| **Progress %** | Percentage complete |
| **ETA** | Estimated time remaining |

<Note>
  ETA is dynamically calculated based on current processing speed.
</Note>

## Controlling Jobs

### Pause

Click **Pause** to temporarily stop processing:
- Current batch completes before pausing
- No new rows start
- Results so far are saved
- Job can be resumed later

**Use cases:**
- Need to check partial results
- API issues you want to investigate
- Taking a break

### Resume

Click **Resume** to continue a paused job:
- Picks up where it left off
- Previously completed rows are not re-processed
- Continues until all rows done

### Cancel

Click **Cancel** to stop a job permanently:
- Stops all processing
- Completed results are kept
- Cannot be undone
- Remaining rows are not processed

<Warning>
  Cancelled jobs cannot be resumed. Completed results are preserved, but you'd need to create a new job to process remaining rows.
</Warning>

## Parallel Processing

Smelt processes multiple rows simultaneously for speed:

- **Concurrency:** 5 parallel API calls
- **Rate limiting:** Built-in delays to prevent API throttling
- **Retry logic:** 3 attempts per row with exponential backoff

This means:
- Jobs complete faster than sequential processing
- Large jobs (10K+ rows) are still manageable
- Temporary API errors are handled automatically

## What Happens If a Job Fails

If an error stops the job:

1. **Completed rows are saved** — You don't lose progress
2. **Error details available** — Check the job details page
3. **Re-run option** — You can re-run failed rows only

### Common Failure Causes

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| API key invalid | Check Settings > API Keys |
| Rate limit hit | Wait and resume, or job auto-retries |
| Usage limit exceeded | Upgrade plan |
| Network error | Check connection, retry |

## Crash Recovery

If something goes wrong mid-job:

- Results are saved after each row (crash-safe)
- You can see partial results
- Resume or re-run failed rows

<Tip>
  Smelt is designed for large jobs. Processing 10,000+ rows is routine and results are protected throughout.

## Viewing Active Jobs

Go to **Jobs** in the sidebar to see:
- Currently running jobs with live progress
- Recent completed jobs
- Failed jobs that need attention
