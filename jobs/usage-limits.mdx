# Usage & Limits

Understanding how Smelt counts usage and what happens when you reach your limit.

## How Rows Are Counted

**Each template × each row = 1 usage**

| Scenario | Rows | Templates | Usage |
|----------|------|-----------|-------|
| Simple job | 100 | 1 | 100 |
| Multi-template | 100 | 3 | 300 |
| Large batch | 1,000 | 2 | 2,000 |
| Big campaign | 10,000 | 3 | 30,000 |

### Example Calculation

You have a Growth plan (25,000 rows/month):

- Job 1: 5,000 rows × 2 templates = 10,000 usage
- Job 2: 3,000 rows × 3 templates = 9,000 usage
- Job 3: 2,000 rows × 1 template = 2,000 usage
- **Total:** 21,000 / 25,000 used
- **Remaining:** 4,000 rows

## What Counts Toward Usage

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="✅ Counts" icon="check">
    - Job processing
    - Template tests
    - Re-runs of failed rows
    - Each template in multi-template jobs
  </Card>
  <Card title="❌ Doesn't Count" icon="xmark">
    - File uploads
    - Template creation
    - Viewing results
    - Exporting CSVs
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  **Template tests count!** Each test consumes 1 row of your monthly allowance.
</Warning>

## Monthly Limits by Plan

| Plan | Rows/Month |
|------|------------|
| Free | 250 |
| Starter | 5,000 |
| Growth | 25,000 |
| Scale | 100,000 |

## What Happens at Your Limit

When you reach your monthly row limit:

1. **Jobs are blocked** — Cannot start new jobs
2. **Clear error message** — Shows usage details
3. **Upgrade prompt** — Link to upgrade plan
4. **Running jobs pause** — If mid-processing

### The Error Message Shows

- Current usage (e.g., 25,000/25,000)
- Rows requested
- Why it's blocked
- How to resolve (upgrade or wait)

<Note>
  You won't be charged overage fees. Jobs simply won't run until you upgrade or your usage resets.
</Note>

## Checking Your Usage

### In the Dashboard
The dashboard shows:
- Rows used this month
- Rows remaining
- Usage percentage

### In Settings
Go to **Settings > Billing** for detailed usage:
- Current plan
- Billing cycle dates
- Exact usage numbers

## Usage Reset

- **Resets** at the start of each billing cycle
- **No rollover** of unused rows
- **Monthly billing** cycle from signup date

<Warning>
  Unused rows do NOT roll over. Use them before your cycle resets!
</Warning>

## Planning Your Usage

### Before Starting a Job

The job creation wizard shows:
- How many rows you're about to use
- Your current remaining balance
- Whether the job will fit

### Usage Strategy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Test small first">
    Run 10-20 rows to verify templates before committing thousands.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Count templates">
    Remember: 3 templates = 3x the usage. Only use templates you need.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor throughout the month">
    Check the dashboard regularly to avoid surprises.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Upgrade proactively">
    If you're regularly hitting limits, upgrade before it blocks work.
  </Accordion>
