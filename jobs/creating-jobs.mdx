A job combines a file with one or more templates to generate personalized copy for each row.

**Job = File + Templates + Row Range**

## Job Creation Wizard

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Select File">
    Choose from your uploaded CSV files.
    
    You'll see:
    - File name
    - Row count
    - Column count
    - Quality score
    
    <Tip>
      Higher quality scores generally produce better personalization.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Step 2: Choose Row Range">
    Select which rows to process:
    
    - **All rows:** Process the entire file
    - **Custom range:** Set start and end rows
    
    <Tip>
      Start with 10-20 rows to test before processing thousands.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Step 3: Select Templates">
    Choose one or more templates from **your templates** (not the Template Library).
    
    **If using multiple templates:**
    - Order matters for chaining!
    - Earlier outputs can be used in later templates
    - Drag to reorder if needed
    
    <Info>
      **Template order matters!** Templates run top-to-bottom. Use `{{OutputColumnName}}` from earlier templates in later ones.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Step 4: Review & Start">
    Review before starting:
    
    - Total rows to process
    - Templates selected
    - Estimated cost
    - Usage impact
    
    Click **Start Job** to begin processing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Template Selection

### What Templates Are Available

Only templates from **My Templates** appear in the job wizard:
- ✅ Templates you created
- ✅ Templates you duplicated from the Library
- ❌ System templates (must duplicate first)

### Multiple Templates

You can select multiple templates per job:

| Templates | Usage Per Row | Example |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| 1 | 1 | Hook only |
| 2 | 2 | Hook + CTA |
| 3 | 3 | Hook + Pain Point + CTA |

<Warning>
  Each template × each row = usage. 3 templates on 1,000 rows = 3,000 usage.
</Warning>

### Template Order for Chaining

If you're using template chaining (where Template B uses output from Template A):

1. Put Template A first in the list
2. Put Template B second
3. Template A's output column becomes available to Template B

## Row Range Selection

### All Rows
Process every row in the file. Best for final runs.

### Custom Range
Set specific start and end rows:
- **Start row:** First row to process (1-based)
- **End row:** Last row to process

**Use cases for custom range:**
- Test on first 20 rows
- Process in batches
- Skip header issues
- Re-run specific sections

## Cost Estimation

Before starting, you'll see:
- **Estimated tokens:** Approximate token usage
- **Estimated cost:** Dollar cost (based on model pricing)
- **Usage impact:** How many rows of your limit this consumes

<Note>
  Estimates are approximations. Actual costs may vary slightly based on output lengths.
</Note>
