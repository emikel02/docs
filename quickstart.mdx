## Common First-Timer Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need an API key to start?">
    No! Free tier uses Smelt's platform key automatically. You only need your own key if you choose BYOK billing mode on a paid plan.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if my output quality is bad?">
    Check the quality flags for specific issues. Common fixes: improve your prompt, add more specific instructions, or ensure your CSV has enough data.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I test before running a full job?">
    Yes! Use the Test feature in the template editor. But note: tests count toward your monthly usage.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I use the outputs in my email tool?">
    Export results as CSV. The new AI-generated columns become personalization variables in Instantly, Lemlist, etc.
