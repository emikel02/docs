# Common Issues

Quick solutions to problems you might encounter.

## File Upload Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="File upload fails immediately">
    **Possible causes:**
    - File is not a CSV
    - File is larger than 50MB
    - File is empty
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Export from your source as CSV
    - Split large files into smaller batches
    - Verify file has data rows
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Garbled characters in preview">
    **Cause:** Encoding mismatch
    
    **Solution:** Re-export your file as UTF-8:
    - Excel: Save As → CSV UTF-8
    - Google Sheets: File → Download → CSV (auto UTF-8)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Columns not detected correctly">
    **Cause:** Non-standard column names
    
    **Solution:** Column detection is just for display. Use exact column names from your CSV in templates with `{{Column Name}}` syntax.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Quality score is low">
    **Cause:** Missing data, empty cells, or data quality issues
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Fill in missing critical fields (name, company, email)
    - Remove empty rows
    - Fix invalid email formats
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Template Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Variables not being replaced">
    **Cause:** Column name mismatch
    
    **Solution:** 
    - Check exact column name in your CSV
    - Use `{{Exact Column Name}}` with exact spelling
    - Column matching is case-insensitive
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Output is too generic">
    **Causes:**
    - Prompt too vague
    - Not enough variables used
    - Missing data in CSV
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Add more specific instructions
    - Reference more columns
    - Check that CSV has data in referenced columns
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Output ignores my instructions">
    **Causes:**
    - Instructions buried in long prompt
    - Conflicting instructions
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Put key instructions at the end of prompt
    - Use "IMPORTANT:" prefix
    - Simplify conflicting requirements
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="AI adds unwanted text">
    **Examples:** "Here's a hook:", "Let me know!"
    
    **Solution:** Smelt auto-fixes most of these. If you still see them:
    - Add explicit instruction: "Do not include any preamble or sign-off"
    - Edit manually if occasional
