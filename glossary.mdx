  <Accordion title="Auto-Fix">

  </Accordion>

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Confidence Score">
    A 0-100 rating of **input data completeness** for each row. Higher score = more data was available for the AI to use. Not a rating of output quality.

    The closing line of a cold email that prompts the reader to take action. Example: "Open to a quick call this week?"
