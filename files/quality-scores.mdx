# Quality Scores

Every uploaded file receives a quality score from 0-100, helping you understand your data's readiness for copy generation.

## How Quality Score Is Calculated

The score starts at 100 and deductions are made for:

| Issue | Max Deduction |
|-------|---------------|
| Empty rows | Up to 20 points |
| Incomplete columns (low avg completeness) | Varies |
| Data quality issues | Up to 30 points |

## Factors That Increase Score

- More complete columns (fewer empty cells)
- Recognized fields present (name, email, company)
- Valid email formats
- No empty rows
- Critical fields have data

## Factors That Decrease Score

- Empty rows in your data
- Low column completeness (less than 50% filled)
- Invalid email formats
- Many empty cells
- Missing critical columns

## Score Ranges

| Score | Rating | Recommendation |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| **80-100** | Excellent | Great data quality, proceed confidently |
| **60-79** | Good | Minor issues, should work well |
| **40-59** | Fair | Review data, consider cleaning |
| **Below 40** | Poor | Clean data before processing |

## Viewing Your Quality Score

After upload, the file detail page shows:

- **Overall quality score** (0-100)
- **Column-by-column analysis**
- **Detected field types**
- **Duplicate counts**

## How Quality Affects Results

<Note>
  Quality score reflects your **input data**, not Smelt's output quality.
</Note>

Higher quality input data leads to:
- Better personalization (more context for AI)
- Higher confidence scores on outputs
- Fewer generic results

Lower quality input data may result in:
- More generic outputs
- Lower confidence scores
- More flagged results

## Improving Your Quality Score

<Steps>
  <Step title="Remove Empty Rows">
    Delete any rows without meaningful data
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill Critical Fields">
    Ensure name, company, and email columns are populated
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fix Invalid Emails">
    Correct obviously wrong email formats
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Partial Data">
    Fill in missing job titles, industries, locations where possible
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  You don't need a perfect 100 score. Scores above 60 generally work well for most use cases.
