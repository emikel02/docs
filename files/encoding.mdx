# Supported Formats & Encoding

## File Requirements

| Requirement | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| **Format** | CSV only |
| **Size limit** | 50MB maximum |
| **Maximum columns** | 100 |
| **Maximum rows** | 50,000 per file |

## Supported Encodings

Smelt supports multiple character encodings:

| Encoding | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| **UTF-8** | ✅ Recommended — best compatibility |
| **UTF-16** | Supported |
| **Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1)** | Supported |
| **Windows-1252** | Supported |

<Tip>
  When in doubt, use UTF-8. It handles international characters and is the most widely compatible.
</Tip>

## Exporting as UTF-8

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="From Excel">
    1. File → Save As
    2. Choose "CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited)"
    3. Save
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="From Google Sheets">
    1. File → Download
    2. Choose "Comma Separated Values (.csv)"
    3. Google Sheets exports as UTF-8 by default
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="From Numbers (Mac)">
    1. File → Export To → CSV
    2. Text Encoding: Unicode (UTF-8)
    3. Export
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Duplicate Detection

Smelt automatically detects duplicates in your data:

### What's Detected

| Field | Detection |
|-------|-----------|
| **Emails** | Exact match duplicates |
| **Company names** | Exact match duplicates |
| **Phone numbers** | Exact match duplicates |
| **LinkedIn URLs** | Exact match duplicates |

### Where Duplicates Are Shown

The file detail page displays:
- Duplicate count for each key field
- Which rows contain duplicates

### How Duplicates Affect Processing

<Note>
  Duplicates are still processed — each row generates output.
</Note>

Smelt doesn't automatically remove duplicates. Each row in your CSV will:
- Be processed by your templates
- Generate its own output
- Count toward your usage

<Tip>
  Consider deduplicating before upload if you want to:
  - Save on usage costs
  - Avoid sending duplicate emails
  - Keep your data clean
</Tip>

## Best Practices for CSV Formatting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use headers in the first row">
    Row 1 should contain column names, not data.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consistent column names">
    Keep naming consistent across files if you reuse templates.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No merged cells">
    CSVs don't support merged cells. Unmerge before exporting.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Clean data">
    Trim whitespace, fix obvious typos, remove empty rows.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Avoid special characters in headers">
    Simple alphanumeric column names work best.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Encoding Issues

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Garbled characters (Ã©, â€™) | Wrong encoding detected | Re-save as UTF-8 |
| Missing characters | Incompatible encoding | Re-save as UTF-8 |
| Empty cells showing data | Hidden characters | Clean data, re-export |
