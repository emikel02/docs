description: Automatic column type detection and mapping

Smelt automatically analyzes your CSV headers and sample data to identify standard field types.

## How Detection Works

1. **Header analysis** — Column names matched against known patterns
2. **Confidence scoring** — 0.9 for exact matches, 0.6 for fuzzy matches
3. **Sample verification** — Sample values displayed for confirmation

## 15 Recognized Field Types

Smelt automatically detects these column types:

| # | Field Type | Example Headers |
|---|------------|-----------------|
| 1 | First Name | `first_name`, `FirstName`, `First` |
| 2 | Last Name | `last_name`, `LastName`, `Surname` |
| 3 | Full Name | `full_name`, `Name`, `Contact Name` |
| 4 | Email | `email`, `Email Address`, `Contact Email` |
| 5 | Phone | `phone`, `Phone Number`, `Mobile` |
| 6 | Company Name | `company`, `Company Name`, `Organization` |
| 7 | Job Title | `title`, `Job Title`, `Position` |
| 8 | Industry | `industry`, `Sector`, `Vertical` |
| 9 | City | `city`, `City`, `Location` |
| 10 | State/Region | `state`, `Region`, `Province` |
| 11 | Country | `country`, `Country`, `Nation` |
| 12 | LinkedIn URL | `linkedin`, `LinkedIn URL`, `Profile` |
| 13 | Website/URL | `website`, `URL`, `Company Website` |
| 14 | Company Size | `company_size`, `Employees`, `Size` |
| 15 | Revenue | `revenue`, `Annual Revenue`, `ARR` |

## Viewing Detected Columns

After upload, the file detail page shows:

- Each column name from your CSV
- Detected field type (if recognized)
- Confidence score
- Sample values from your data

## If Detection Is Wrong

<Note>
  Column detection is for **display purposes only**. It doesn't affect how templates work.
</Note>

In templates, always use the **exact column name** from your CSV:

```text
{{Company Name}}     ✅ Uses your actual column
{{Company}}          ❌ Won't work if column is "Company Name"
```

The detection just helps you understand your data—it doesn't rename or modify columns.

## Unrecognized Columns

Columns that don't match known patterns are still fully usable:

- They appear in the column list
- You can reference them in templates with `{{Column Name}}`
- They just won't have a "detected type" label

## Custom Column Names

You can use any column names you want. Smelt will:

1. List all columns from your CSV
2. Attempt to detect standard types
3. Let you reference any column in templates

<Tip>
  Use descriptive column names like `Pain_Point_Research` or `Recent_News` for custom enrichment data. You can reference these directly in templates.
