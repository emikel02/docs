# Best Practices

Get the most out of Smelt with these proven tips.

---

## Data Preparation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Clean your CSV before upload">
    - Remove empty rows
    - Trim whitespace from cells
    - Fix obvious typos in company names
    - Standardize job titles where possible
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use consistent column naming">
    Keep column names consistent across files if you reuse templates. `Company` and `Company Name` are different variables.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Deduplicate before upload">
    While Smelt detects duplicates, removing them beforehand saves processing and usage.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Include rich data fields">
    The more context you provide, the better the personalization:
    - Job title + seniority level
    - Industry + sub-industry
    - Company size + growth stage
    - Location (city, not just country)
    - Recent news or funding info
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use UTF-8 encoding">
    When exporting from Excel or Google Sheets, always choose UTF-8 for best compatibility.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Template Writing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be specific about output format">
    Tell the AI exactly what you want:
    
    ❌ "Write a hook"
    
    ✅ "Write a 1-sentence opening hook under 150 characters. Start with their pain point, not a compliment."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Include examples in your prompt">
    Show the AI what good output looks like:
    
    ```
    Example outputs:
    - "Scaling a SaaS team in Austin's competitive market takes serious capital—"
    - "Construction projects don't wait for slow bank approvals—"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Specify what NOT to include">
    Use forbidden words and explicit instructions:
    
    ```
    Do NOT include:
    - Generic phrases like "hope this finds you well"
    - Questions in the opening line
    - The word "excited"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Set appropriate length limits">
    - **Hooks:** 100-200 characters
    - **Pain points:** 150-300 characters
    - **Full emails:** 500-1000 characters
    - **CTAs:** 50-100 characters
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use all relevant variables">
    Reference your data in the prompt:
    
    ```
    Write a hook for {{First Name}}, a {{Job Title}} at {{Company}} 
    in {{City}}, {{Industry}} industry.
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test before bulk runs">
    Always test on 5-10 rows before running thousands. It's worth the small usage cost to catch prompt issues early.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Cost Optimization

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use BYOK for high volume">
    If processing 10,000+ rows/month, BYOK saves significant money. You pay ~$0.001-0.002 per row vs $0.02-0.10 on per-credit platforms.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test on small row ranges first">
    When creating a new job, start with 10-50 rows to verify output quality. Then scale up.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Reuse templates across jobs">
    Build a library of tested templates. Reuse them rather than recreating from scratch each time.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitor usage regularly">
    Check Settings → Billing to track your usage against limits. Avoid surprises.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Be strategic with template chains">
    Each template in a chain multiplies usage:
    - 1,000 rows × 1 template = 1,000 usage
    - 1,000 rows × 3 templates = 3,000 usage
    
    Only chain when you need the output dependency.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Batch similar campaigns">
    If running multiple campaigns with the same template, combine into one job when possible.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quality Optimization

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review flagged outputs first">
    Filter results by "has flags" and review those first. They're most likely to need edits.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use forbidden words strategically">
    Add words that don't fit your brand:
    - Competitor names
    - Overused phrases ("synergy", "leverage")
    - Words that trigger spam filters
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Iterate on your prompts">
    If outputs are consistently off, revise the prompt:
    1. Run small test batch
    2. Review outputs
    3. Identify patterns in bad outputs
    4. Adjust prompt
    5. Repeat
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Add context to your templates">
    Help the AI understand your product/offer:
    
    ```
    Context: We provide fast business funding ($10K-$500K) 
    with approval in 24 hours. Our target is small businesses 
    that need capital quickly.
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Workflow Tips

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Start Simple" icon="seedling">
    Begin with 1 template (hook or first line). Add more templates after you've validated quality.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Document Your Templates" icon="file-lines">
    Use clear names: "SaaS Hook v2 - Pain Focus" not "Template 1"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Version Your Templates" icon="code-branch">
    When iterating, duplicate and rename: "Hook v1" → "Hook v2" rather than editing in place.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Export Regularly" icon="download">
    Download results after each job completes. Don't rely on Smelt as long-term storage.
  </Card>
