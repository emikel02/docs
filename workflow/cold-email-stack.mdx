## CSV Column Mapping

Your sending tool uses Smelt's output columns as personalization variables:

| Smelt Output Column | In Instantly | In Lemlist | In Smartlead |
|---------------------|--------------|------------|--------------|
| `Hook` | `{{Hook}}` | `{{Hook}}` | `{{Hook}}` |
| `Pain_Point` | `{{Pain_Point}}` | `{{Pain_Point}}` | `{{Pain_Point}}` |
| `CTA` | `{{CTA}}` | `{{CTA}}` | `{{CTA}}` |
| `First_Line` | `{{First_Line}}` | `{{First_Line}}` | `{{First_Line}}` |

<Tip>
  Name your output columns clearly—they become the personalization variables in your sending tool!
</Tip>

## Why Smelt vs. Built-In AI?

Many sending tools have built-in AI personalization. Here's why Smelt is different:

| Feature | Smelt | Built-in AI (Instantly, Lemlist) |
|---------|-------|----------------------------------|
| **Pricing** | BYOK (10-50x cheaper) | Per-credit |
| **Custom prompts** | Fully customizable | Limited options |
| **Quality scoring** | 11 quality flags + auto-fix | Basic or none |
| **Template chaining** | ✅ Multi-step workflows | ❌ |
| **Template library** | 17 pre-built templates | Varies |
| **Batch testing** | ✅ Before full runs | Limited |
| **Works with any sender** | ✅ CSV export | Locked into platform |
| **Cost transparency** | See exact API costs | Hidden in credits |

## The Cost Advantage

**Example: 50,000 leads/month with 2 templates = 100,000 AI generations**

| Method | Cost |
|--------|------|
| Clay AI credits | $2,000 - $10,000 |
| Instantly AI credits | $500 - $2,000 |
| **Smelt BYOK** | **$100 - $200** |

<Note>
  Smelt isn't replacing your sending tool—it's giving you better personalization before you send.
</Note>

## What If I Don't Have Enriched Data?

Smelt works with whatever data you have:

| Your Data | What Smelt Can Do |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Just name, email, company | Generate basic personalization |
| + Job title, industry | Generate role-specific messaging |
| + Location, company size | Add regional/scale context |
| + Tech stack, funding | Deep personalization with specifics |

<Tip>
  More data = better personalization. But even basic fields (name, company, title) create significantly better results than generic templates.
</Tip>
