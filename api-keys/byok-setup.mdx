## Verifying Your Key

After adding:

1. Smelt will validate the key format
2. You can click "Test" to verify it works
3. If valid, the key is ready to use

### Test Results

| Result | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ Valid | Key works and has credits |
| ❌ Invalid | Key format wrong or revoked |
| ⚠️ No credits | Key valid but no OpenAI credits |

## Managing Multiple Keys

You can add multiple API keys:

- Different keys for different purposes
- Backup keys
- Keys with different spending limits

Only one key is active at a time. Select which key to use in Settings.

## OpenAI Credits

BYOK means you pay OpenAI directly for API usage.

### Adding Credits

1. Go to [platform.openai.com/account/billing](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing)
2. Add a payment method
3. Add credits or set up auto-recharge

### Monitoring Usage

Check your OpenAI usage at:
- platform.openai.com/usage

<Tip>
  Set up usage alerts in OpenAI to avoid running out of credits mid-job.
</Tip>

## API Key Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use a dedicated key for Smelt">
    Create a separate API key just for Smelt. Easier to track usage and revoke if needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Set spending limits">
    In OpenAI, set monthly spending limits to prevent unexpected costs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor regularly">
    Check your OpenAI dashboard periodically to track spend.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rotate keys periodically">
    For security, consider rotating keys every few months.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API key"

- Check for typos or extra spaces
- Ensure you copied the full key
- Try generating a new key

### "Insufficient credits"

- Add credits in your OpenAI account
- Set up auto-recharge

### "Rate limit exceeded"

- Wait a minute and retry
- Check your OpenAI tier limits
- Consider upgrading your OpenAI plan

<Note>
  Smelt handles rate limiting with automatic retries, but severe rate limits may still cause issues.
