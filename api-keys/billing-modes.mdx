## Free Tier

**Best for:** Trying Smelt, small tests, evaluating the product

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Monthly limit** | 250 rows |
| **Cost** | $0 |
| **API key needed** | No — uses Smelt's platform key |
| **Setup** | None — works immediately |

### How It Works

1. Sign up for free
2. Upload a CSV
3. Run jobs immediately
4. Smelt's platform API key handles all AI calls

<Info>
  Free tier is fully functional. Same features as paid plans, just limited to 250 rows/month.

## BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)

**Best for:** High volume users, cost-conscious teams, maximum savings

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Monthly cost** | $29 / $79 / $199 (by tier) |
| **API key needed** | Yes — your OpenAI key |
| **AI costs** | You pay OpenAI directly (~$0.001-0.002/row) |
| **Total cost** | Subscription + raw API costs |

### How It Works

1. Subscribe to a paid plan (Starter/Growth/Scale)
2. Choose BYOK billing mode
3. Add your OpenAI API key in Settings
4. Jobs use your key — you pay OpenAI directly

### Cost Comparison

| Rows | Per-Credit Tools | BYOK (API only) | Savings |
|------|------------------|-----------------|---------|
| 10,000 | $200-1,000 | $10-20 | 10-50x |
| 50,000 | $1,000-5,000 | $50-100 | 10-50x |
| 100,000 | $2,000-10,000 | $100-200 | 10-50x |

<Tip>
  BYOK is dramatically cheaper at scale. If you process 25K+ rows/month, BYOK saves serious money.
</Tip>

### BYOK Requirements

- OpenAI account with API access
- API key with available credits
- Added to Smelt in Settings > API Keys

## Managed Mode

| **AI costs** | Included in subscription |
| **Total cost** | Just the subscription |

### How It Works

1. Subscribe to a paid plan (Starter/Growth/Scale)
2. Choose Managed billing mode
3. No API key setup needed
4. Smelt handles all AI costs

### Why Choose Managed
