# Security

Understanding how Smelt protects your data, API keys, and account.

## API Key Security

### Encryption

Your API keys are encrypted using **AES-256-GCM**:

- Industry-standard encryption
- Keys are encrypted at rest
- Decrypted only when needed for API calls

### Storage

| Aspect | How It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| **At rest** | Encrypted in database |
| **In transit** | HTTPS/TLS encryption |
| **Display** | Never shown after saving |
| **Access** | Only your account can use your keys |

### What We Never Do

- ❌ Store keys in plain text
- ❌ Log keys in application logs
- ❌ Share keys between accounts
- ❌ Display keys after initial entry

<Note>
  Once you save an API key, you cannot view it again. You can only delete and add a new one.
</Note>

## Data Security

### Your CSV Data

| Aspect | Protection |
|--------|------------|
| **Storage** | Encrypted cloud storage (AWS S3) |
| **Access** | Isolated per account |
| **Transmission** | HTTPS/TLS encrypted |
| **Retention** | You control deletion |

### Data Isolation

Your data is completely isolated:

- Other users cannot see your files
- Other users cannot see your results
- Other users cannot see your templates
- No cross-account data access

### AI Processing

When BYOK mode is used:
- Data goes directly to OpenAI under your API key
- No third-party AI intermediaries
- Subject to OpenAI's data policies

When Managed mode is used:
- Data goes to OpenAI under Smelt's API key
- Same OpenAI data policies apply

## Account Security

### Password Protection

- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost factor 12)
- Never stored in plain text
- Rate limiting on login attempts (5 attempts / 15 min)
- Rate limiting on registration (3 / hour)

### Session Security

- JWT-based sessions
- 30-day session duration
- Automatic logout after inactivity

### Password Reset

- Secure token-based reset
- Tokens expire after 1 hour
- Tokens are single-use
- Rate limited (3 requests / hour / email)

## Infrastructure Security

### Application Security

| Measure | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Security headers** | X-Frame-Options, CSP, etc. |
| **HTTPS** | All traffic encrypted |
| **Rate limiting** | Protected endpoints |
| **Input validation** | All user input validated |

### Data Backup

- Regular database backups
- Encrypted backup storage
- Point-in-time recovery capability

## Compliance Considerations

### GDPR

For EU users:
- You can request data export
- You can request account deletion
- Data processing documented

### Data Retention

- Data retained while account active
- Deleted upon account deletion request
- No automatic data mining or resale

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use a strong password">
    At least 12 characters with mixed case, numbers, and symbols.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Don't share API keys">
    Never share your OpenAI API key. Create separate keys per service.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use dedicated API keys">
    Create an API key specifically for Smelt so you can track and revoke it separately.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor API usage">
    Regularly check your OpenAI usage dashboard for unexpected activity.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Set spending limits">
    Configure spending limits in OpenAI to prevent unexpected costs.
