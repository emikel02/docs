## Writing Effective Prompts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be specific about output format">
    ❌ "Write something about their company"
    
    ✅ "Write a 1-sentence opening hook mentioning their company's recent growth"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Include what NOT to include">
    ```text
    Don't use:
    - "I hope this finds you well"
    - Questions in the opening
    - The word "excited"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Specify length clearly">
    ```text
    Keep it under 150 characters.
    Maximum 2 sentences.
    One short paragraph only.
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Give examples if helpful">
    ```text
    Example output style:
    "Scaling a SaaS sales team in Austin's competitive market is no small feat—"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reference your actual offer">
    ```text

    Tie the hook to how quick capital could help their situation.
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Output Column Name

The **Output Column Name** determines:
- What the new CSV column will be called
- How you reference it in template chaining
- What variable name appears in your sending tool

<Tip>
  Use clear, descriptive names like `Hook`, `Pain_Point`, `CTA` rather than generic names like `Output1`.
</Tip>

## Character and Word Limits

Set constraints to control output length:

| Setting | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Character Limit** | AI tries to stay under X characters |
| **Word Limit** | AI tries to stay under X words |
| **Both** | AI respects whichever is more restrictive |

<Note>
  Limits are guidelines for the AI, not hard cutoffs. Outputs may occasionally exceed limits slightly. The quality flag system will catch these.
</Note>

## Forbidden Words

Add words that should never appear in outputs:

- Enter as comma-separated list or tags
- Common uses: competitor names, banned phrases, overused words
- Outputs containing forbidden words get flagged

**Example forbidden words:**
```text
loan, synergy, circle back, touch base, I hope this finds you well
```

## AI Model Settings

| Setting | Default | Recommendation |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Model** | gpt-4o-mini | Keep default for best cost/quality |
| **Temperature** | 0.7 | Lower (0.3) for consistent, higher (0.9) for creative |
| **Max Tokens** | 150 | Increase for longer outputs |

## Testing Before Use

After creating a template, **test it** before running a full job:

1. Open the template
2. Select a file to test with
3. Click **Test**
4. Review outputs and quality flags
5. Iterate on the prompt if needed

<Warning>
  Template tests count toward your monthly usage!
