description: Test your templates before running full jobs

Test your templates with real data before running full jobs to catch issues early.

## Why Test First

- ✅ Verify prompt produces good output
- ✅ Check quality flags for issues
- ✅ See cost estimates
- ✅ Catch variable problems
- ✅ Iterate quickly without wasting usage

<Warning>
  Template tests count toward your monthly usage! Each test consumes 1 row of your allowance.
</Warning>

## How to Test a Template

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Template">
    Go to Templates and click on the template you want to test
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a Test File">
    Choose a file from your uploaded CSVs to use as test data
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Test">
    Click the **Test** button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Results">
    See generated output, quality flags, token usage, and cost
  </Step>
  <Step title="Iterate if Needed">
    Adjust your prompt and test again until satisfied
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What You'll See in Test Results

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Generated Output** | The AI's response for the test row |
| **Quality Flags** | Any issues detected (too short, forbidden word, etc.) |
| **Token Usage** | Input and output tokens consumed |
| **Cost** | Estimated cost for this generation |
| **Input Data** | The row data that was used |
| **Built Prompt** | The final prompt sent to the AI (with variables filled) |

## Testing Unsaved Templates

You can test a template **before saving it**:

1. Fill in the template form (name, prompt, etc.)
2. Select a test file
3. Click **Test** 
4. Review results
5. Then save if satisfied

This lets you iterate on your prompt without creating multiple saved versions.

## Interpreting Test Results

### Good Results
- ✅ Output is relevant and personalized
- ✅ No quality flags (or only minor ones)
- ✅ Length is appropriate
- ✅ Matches your intended tone

### Warning Signs
- ⚠️ Output is too generic
- ⚠️ Quality flags present
- ⚠️ AI ignored your instructions
- ⚠️ Variables didn't resolve correctly

### What to Do If Results Are Poor

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Output is too generic">
    Add more specific instructions. Include examples. Reference more data columns.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Output is too long/short">
    Add explicit length constraints: "Keep under 100 characters" or "Write 2-3 sentences"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="AI ignored instructions">
    Make instructions clearer. Put them at the end of the prompt. Use "IMPORTANT:" prefix.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Variables show as empty">
    Check that column names match exactly. View your file to verify column names.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Contains forbidden words">
    The AI might not follow forbidden words perfectly. Make the prohibition clearer in your prompt too.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Testing Multiple Rows

The test feature runs on sample rows from your file. This gives you a representative output without processing the entire file.

<Tip>
  If testing consistently produces good results, you can confidently run a full job.
</Tip>

## Cost of Testing

Each test:
- Uses 1 row of your monthly allowance
- Consumes tokens (billed if BYOK)
- Counts toward usage tracking

**Recommendation:** Test 3-5 times to iterate, then run a small batch (10-20 rows) as a final verification before processing thousands.
